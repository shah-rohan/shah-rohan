I am an M.D./Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying chromatin epigenetics in the Ruthenburg Laboratory. My research interests include developing quantitative applications of common techniques in modern molecular biology. This includes designing methods for quantitative studies of chromatin immunoprecipitation and creating novel tools for analysis of next-generation sequencing data.
